  <h2>Equality, women and cinerary urns</h2>
  <p>
    
    Every day we are reminded that gender equality is not a natural given. Currently, this idea has come under threat once more. History shows, however, that the 
    balance between men and women has never been stable. Looking into historical evidence thus might help us to better grasp the nuances in this delicate situation 
    and the debate it ensues. We think that women in Antiquity were very. This idea is based situation in Rome. Sources that, moreover, were written by men. In 
    order to get a more complete picture, we need to consider other situations and other types of evidence. One group that could help are the Etruscans, who in Antiquity lived in Northern Italy, precisely because they left virtually no written sources. 
    We know most about them because of the necropoleis, or the cities of the dead that have been well preserved. How people are buried tells a lot about the values 
    of a society. Here, we will look into the Etruscan cinerary urns and what this can tell us about the role of women in their society.<img alt="Alabaster cinerary urn | Etruscan | Hellenistic | The Met" class="n3VNCb" src="https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/gr/original/DP109259.jpg" data-noaft="1" jsname="HiaYvf" jsaction="load:XAeZkd;" style="width: 400px; height: 400.106px; float:"centre"">

    The Etruscan funerary urns have several aspects that are interesting to consider. The first observation is that many more urns containing man than women have 
    been found. However, this does not mean that women were less equal, it might just point to a different type of equality. For example, the material of the urn 
    might provide more information on this. <img alt="Terracotta cinerary urn | Etruscan | Hellenistic | The Met" class="n3VNCb" src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/246267/543192/main-image" data-noaft="1" jsname="HiaYvf" jsaction="load:XAeZkd;" style="width: 200px; height: 252px; float:"centre""> 
     <br>
    Firstly, the material of the urn says something about value. Different techniques and stones were used. Stones like alabaster needed to be carved by hand, 
    whereas the frequently used terracotta allowed for mass production. Consequently, we can conclude that alabaster urns required higher costs then terracotta 
    ones. More of the urns containing women are made of these more precious stones, therefore showing more money was put into these monuments to the deceased. Not 
    only are the types of stone different, the relief used in female urns is also of a higher quality. Lastly, female urns also have more individual markers. The 
    hairstyle differs on the female urns. Historians think that the hairstyles represent the way the deceased wore their hair in life. Besides hair, necklaces and 
    bracelets are also common on these types of urns. When family would visit the necropolis they believed in spirit would be there to.  These cinerary urns help 
    to commemorate the person who die, they would see the image of their loved one.
      <br>  <br>
    It is, therefore, relevant to assess urns for men and women differently. Though male ones were more common, female ones seem to have been made with more 
    reverence to remember the deceased. Men might have wanted to have urns more as a status symbol, to show they were wealthy enough to get one. Women were 
    commemorated by their family. The number of female urns found, however, points to another reason for the discrepancy in numbers. Keeping this in mind, based on 
    these urns women and men used cinerary urns have different functions, but this does not mean they are less equal. Women were buried similarly, showing their 
    status was equal.
