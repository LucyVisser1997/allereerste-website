  <h2>Equality, women and cinerary urns</h2>
  <p>
   Gender equality has been a hot topic for many years. Now, in 2020, it seems that this equality is under threat once more. Throughout history the relations 
    between women and men have varied. Looking into these relations might make help see alternatives to our way of thinking. We think that women in Antiquity 
    were very much the underdog when we look at Rome. This is based on written sources. Written by man. It seems, therefore, that it might be worth trying to 
    look at the situation again but using different sources. In Northern Italy lived the Etruscans, who did not leave a lot of written sources. 
    We know most about them because of the necropoleis, or the cities of the dead, they left behind. How people are buried tells a lot about the values of a 
    society. Here, we will look into the Etruscan burial practices and the role of women in their society. 
      <br>
      <br>
    The Etruscan funerary urns have several different aspects that are interesting to consider. The first observation is that many more urns containing man 
    than women have been found. However, this does not mean that women were less equal, it might just means point to a different type of equality. For example, 
    the type and make of the urn might provide more information on this.   <img {float: right;} alt="Terracotta cinerary urn | Etruscan | Hellenistic | The Met" class="n3VNCb" src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/246267/543192/main-image" data-noaft="1" jsname="HiaYvf" jsaction="load:XAeZkd;" style="width: 400px; height: 505.796px; margin: 0px;">
    Firstly, the make of the urn says something about the value. Different techniques and stones were used. Stones like alabaster need to be carved by hand, were 
    as the frequently used terracotta allowed for mass produced. It seems therefore, that alabaster urns must have cost more than terracotta ones. More of the 
    urns containing women are made of these more precious stones, therefore seeming to show that more money was put into these monuments to the deceased. Not only 
    are the types of stone different, the relief is also of a higher quality. Lastly, it seems that female urns also have many more individual markers. 
    The hairstyle differs greatly on the female urns. It is thought that the hairstyles represent the wat the deceased wore their hair in life. Besides hair, 
    necklaces and bracelets are also common on these types of urns. These objects seem to help to commemorate the person who died, for when the family would visit 
    the necropolis, they would see the image of their loved one, who they believed in spirit would be there to.  
      <br>  <br>
    It might seem, therefore, relevant to assess urns for male and female in a different way. Though male ones were more common, female ones seem to have been made 
    with more reverence to remember the deceased. Men might have wanted to have urns more as a status symbol, to show they were wealthy enough to get one. Women 
    were commemorated by their family. Keeping that in mind, based on these urns women and men used cinerary urns have different functions, but this does not mean 
    they are less equal.
