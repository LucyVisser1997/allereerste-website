    Every day we are reminded that gender equality is not a natural given. History shows, however, that the balance between men and women has never been stable. 
    Looking into historical evidence could, therefore, help us better grasp the nuances in this delicate situation and the debate it ensues. We think, for example 
    that women in Antiquity were very unequal. This idea is based mainly on Roman written sources. Texts that, moreover, were written by men. In order to get a more 
    complete picture, we need to consider other situations and other types of evidence. One group that could help us are the Etruscans, who in Antiquity lived in 
    Northern Italy, precisely because they left almost no written sources. We know most about them because of their necropoleis, or the cities of the dead, that have 
    been well preserved. How people were buried tells a lot about the values of a society. On this page, we will look into the Etruscan cinerary urns and what this 
    can tell us about the role of women in their society.  
      <br>
      <br>    
    The Etruscan funerary urns have several aspects that are interesting to consider. The first observation is that many more urns have been found that contain the 
    remains of men than of women. 
        <img alt="Terracotta cinerary urn | Etruscan | Hellenistic | The Met" src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/246267/543192/main-image" data-noaft="1" jsname="HiaYvf" jsaction="load:XAeZkd;" style="float:left;width:250px;height:280px;""> 
    However, this does not mean that women were considered less, it just points to a different type of estimation. The material of the urn provides more 
    information on this.
    <br>
    Firstly, the material of the urn says something about its value. Alabaster urns were more expensive, and it is precisely this type of stone that has been most 
    often used for urns that contain women. Etruscans thus spent more money on the monuments to their deceased women than men. Not only are the types of stone different, 
    the relief used in female urns is also of a higher quality. Lastly, female urns also have more elements that point to the individuality of the women depicted. 
    The hairstyles differ on the female urns. Historians think that the hairstyles represent the way the deceased wore their hair in life. Besides hair, necklaces 
    and bracelets are also common on these types of urns. These cinerary urns thus helped to commemorate the person who died, because they would see the image of their 
    loved one when family members would visit the necropolis, as they believed the spirit would be there too. 
  <br>

    It is, therefore, relevant to assess urns for men and women differently. Though male ones were more common, female ones weer made with more 
    reverence to remember the deceased. We can see here a great appreciation for women in the Etruscan culture, because why else would they put so much effort and 
    money into creating these memorials to the dead? 
    <br>
    <br>
    Relating this idea to the modern day, we might be helped when trying to define equality. Women are in some ways not the same, this is undeniably true. Equality 
    for women might not mean being treated exactly the same as men, but treated similarly and most importantly, with respect.
