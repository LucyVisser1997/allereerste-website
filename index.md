# Academic profile 

Lucy Visser is a student in the Research Master Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies at Utrecht University, where she previously completed a BA in History. She specializes in Ancient Studies with a focus on the Etruscan civilization, notably the intersections of religion and gender. This has culminated in her BA Thesis on social difference in Etruscan funerary culture. Her interest in religion and gender also extend to Roman and Greek history. In her future research she intends to contribute to re-evaluating the Etruscan civilization, in order better understand its role within the Mediterranean context.
